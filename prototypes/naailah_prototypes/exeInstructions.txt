To create an executable:

Step 1: 
Navigate to the directory where the Python script is located (In this case the script is tkinterprototype.py)

Step 2: 
Run PyInstaller from the terminal: 
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed "filename"

This will create an executable without a terminal window popping up (because of --windowed), and everything will be bundled into a single file (because of --onefile).

The executable file can then be found under a dist folder
