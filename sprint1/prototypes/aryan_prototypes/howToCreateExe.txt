Note: Make sure you have CD'd into the appropriate folder, in this case aryan_prototypes

In order to create an exe file, make sure you run:
pyinstaller --onefile --hidden-import=tkinter "filename"

For example, in this prototype, run the following code:
pyinstaller --onefile --hidden-import=tkinter tkinterTest.py

Have to include --hidden-import otherwise it does not include
tkinter and doesn't run.
